ALLISON FAMILY GENEALOGY

This repository contains source data for my attempt at recording the family tree of ancestors of
Denis George Allison 1920 – 2005, and
Hazel Jordan 1923 – 2000.

The tree can be found at: https://www.familysearch.org/tree/pedigree/landscape/LJ1N-K39
You will need to create an account at https://www.familysearch.org to view this, but there is no charge for doing so.

Caution:
The site is publicly visible,
please don’t post any information regarding people who are still living.

I quickly found I had far too much information to upload it all to familysearch.org, so I have saved it here.

In addition to Census data, and Birth and Marriage certificates,
there is also:
A family history written by John Charles (Jack) Allison in 1994
George Allison's Military History
Some of Denis Allison's tramping photos
Various articles and newspaper clippings which mention family members.
Various ships passenger lists, although I was unsuccessful at finding family in these.

The data is roughly structured as a family tree, and is sort of browsable, although nothing has been prepared for display. If a document won't display in your browser, you can right click and download it.
In any family's folder, the parent's names start with an underscore.
This used to bring them to the top of the list on some system I was working on, but it doesn't seem to work here.

This work was done in 2014.
There may be more information available on the internet by now.

Dave Allison.
